# SysApi
## A system information api.
---

This is a simple web API that returns information about the system. Currently, it is not capable of manipulating the system in any way. Only GET methods are accepted, and no files can be changed via the API.

I do not intend to add any system of authorization to this API due to it's simplicity, however a basic password system may be implemented in the future.
